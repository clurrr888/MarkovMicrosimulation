Later on attach this to local files in computer. 
Commit - commit changes. 
Insights are when files are being modified.
Settings- add collaborators, decide how branches are going to work, customise. 
Source control (or version control) is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. Source control management (SCM) systems provide a running history of code development and help to resolve conflicts when merging contributions from multiple sources.

Sharing Code: Health economists may develop software tools, scripts, or algorithms for data analysis, modeling, or simulation. They can share their code on GitHub to make it accessible to others in the field and to collaborate with peers.
Reproducibility: Reproducibility is crucial in scientific research, including health economics. By hosting their code and analysis pipelines on GitHub, researchers can make their work more transparent and reproducible by others.
Project Management: GitHub provides tools for project management, issue tracking, and collaboration, which can be useful for organizing research projects, coordinating with collaborators, and managing tasks.
Open Access Research: Some health economists may choose to publish their research findings, datasets, and code openly on GitHub to promote open science principles and facilitate knowledge sharing within the community.
Documentation: GitHub's wiki and README features allow researchers to provide documentation for their projects, including instructions for use, explanations of algorithms, and notes on data sources and methodologies.
Version Control: Version control is essential for tracking changes to code and collaborating with others. GitHub's version control system (Git) enables researchers to track changes, manage different versions of their code, and merge contributions from multiple collaborators.
